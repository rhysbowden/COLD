Before you can use coldGA, make sure the following C source files are compiled via Mex: 
1. calc_link_load.c: script to compute link capacities
2. floyd_apsp.c: Floyd-Warshall algorithm
Both were written by Yin Zhang (yzhang@cs.utexax.edu)

--- Primary Files ----
coldGA.m is the genetic algorithm that generates a PoP-level topology.
pops_to_routers.m takes a PoP-level topology and a set of rules, and generates a router level topology using generalised graph products.

--- Examples ----
GAexample1.m runs the PoP-level generator with example parameters.
pops_to_routers_example.m runs PoPs_to_routers with the simplest choices of parameters to generate a router level topology.

--- Other Files ----
chromcost5.m and chromcost7.m are used for evaluating the cost of a topology for given values of k0,k1,k2,k4. They use all_shortest_paths from matlab_bgl, http://dgleich.github.com/matlab-bgl/

chromcost5alt.m and chromcost7alt.m are alternative versions of chromcost5.m and chromcost7.m that do not require matlab_bgl. They do, however, require the C source files above so it is essential they are compiled.
