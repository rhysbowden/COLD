top_gen11.m is the genetic algorithm that generates a topology.
example1.m runs the generator with example parameters.


chromcost5.m and chromcost7.m are used for evaluating the cost of a topology for given values of k0,k1,k2,k4. They use all_shortest_paths from matlab_bgl, http://dgleich.github.com/matlab-bgl/
